### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at [Passepartour](https://passepartour.de).

In the spare time, I develop [Tournant](https://github.com/zimbelstern/Tournant).

Using solely free software on desktop and mobile, I file issues on some FOSS projects every now and then.

I have experience in Kotlin, Python, PHP, SQL, SVG, Webdesign & some Javascript.

Other things I enjoy are listening to classical music and jazz, playing the piano and the church organ, baking, hiking and dancing quickstep.
